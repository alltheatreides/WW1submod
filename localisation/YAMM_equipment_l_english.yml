 shells_ammunition_0:0 "Shrapnel Shells"
 shells_ammunition_0_desc:0 "Shrapnel shells were anti-personnel artillery munitions which carried a large number of individual bullets close to the target and then ejected them to allow them to continue along the shell's trajectory and strike the target individually. They relied almost entirely on the shell's velocity for their lethality."
 shells_ammunition_1:0 "High Explosive Shells"
 shells_ammunition_1_desc:0 "HE Shells have a strong steel case, a bursting charge, and a fuse. The fuse detonates the bursting charge which shatters the case and scatters hot, sharp case pieces (fragments, splinters) at high velocity. Most of the damage to soft targets, such as unprotected personnel, is caused by shell pieces rather than by the blast."
